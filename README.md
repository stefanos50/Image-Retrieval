# Image-Retrieval
Image Retrieval through Unsupervised Hypergraph-Based Manifold Ranking as described in the paper [MultimediaRetrieval throughUnsupervised Hypergraph-basedManifoldRanking](chrome-extension://efaidnbmnnnibpcajpcglclefindmkaj/https://www.ic.unicamp.br/~dcarlos/papers/journals/IEEE-TIP_2019-AcceptedVersion.pdf). The algorithm is compared with the results that were retrieved from the extracted features by employing the FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search) library, which is also implemented. A subset of the [Animals-10](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/alessiocorrado99/animals10) was utilized to retrieve images before and after fine-tuning the backbone architectures (VGG-16,VGG-19,ResNet-50,ResNet-101).
